#Print Credit Machine Controller 1.0

Commerce I.T. has a number of Print Credit Machines located throughout its labs. The machine is a simple note reader that is activated by a student swiping their student card and then depositing the required amount of money in the note reader. The program interpretes the data received from the machine and updates the network student account accordingly, increasing the print credit balance as required. The program also produces a number of useful stats and logs for auditing purposes.
